ESP32-CAM Flashing Instructions
============================

1. Hardware Setup
----------------
Before connecting power:
a. Connect USB-TTL adapter to ESP32-CAM HW-297:
   - USB-TTL GND  -> ESP32-CAM GND
   - USB-TTL RX   -> ESP32-CAM IO1 (U0T)
   - USB-TTL TX   -> ESP32-CAM IO3 (U0R)
   - USB-TTL 3.3V -> ESP32-CAM 5V or 3V3 (board has voltage regulator)
   - Connect GPIO0 to GND (required for flash mode)

2. Flashing Process
------------------
1. With GPIO0 connected to GND:
   a. Connect USB-TTL adapter to computer
   b. Wait 1-2 seconds
   c. Press and hold RESET button on ESP32-CAM
   d. Run the flash command: make flash-esp32
   e. Release RESET button immediately after running the command
   f. You should see "Connecting..." in the output

3. After Flashing
----------------
1. Disconnect power (unplug USB-TTL)
2. Remove GPIO0 to GND connection
3. Reconnect power for normal operation

4. Troubleshooting
-----------------
If "No serial data received" error:
1. Double-check all connections:
   - Verify RX/TX are crossed (ESP32 TX → USB-TTL RX)
   - Check GPIO0 is solidly connected to GND
   - Ensure all wires are firmly connected

2. Try this reset sequence:
   a. Unplug USB-TTL
   b. Hold RESET button
   c. Plug in USB-TTL
   d. Release RESET
   e. Immediately run: make flash-esp32

3. Power supply checks:
   - Board has built-in voltage regulator, can use 3.3V or 5V
   - Ensure USB-TTL can supply enough current
   - Try a different USB port (some ports provide more power)
   - Add a capacitor (10µF) between 3.3V and GND if available

4. Connection verification:
   - Check if device shows up in: ls /dev/cu.*
   - Try unplugging and replugging USB-TTL
   - Try a different USB cable
   - Verify USB-TTL adapter is working with a different device

5. Software checks:
   - Current baud rate: 9600 (very conservative)
   - Try running 'make erase' first, then flash
   - Check if esptool is installed: esptool.py version

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Not connecting GPIO0 to GND before powering up
- Not crossing RX/TX connections
- Loose or intermittent GPIO0-GND connection
- Releasing RESET button too late
- Bad or high-resistance jumper wires
- Insufficient power supply
